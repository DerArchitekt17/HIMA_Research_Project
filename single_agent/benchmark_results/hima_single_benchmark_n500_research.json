Assessment:** - **Primary Diagnosis:** Malignant neoplasm of unspecified part of the left bronchus or lung. - Rationale: The patient presents with a severe, persistent cough, hemoptysis, significant weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pain. These, combined with his history of heavy smoking and family history of lung cancer, strongly suggest a malignant process. Chest X-ray revealing a large mass in the left lung supports this assessment.**4. Plan:** - **Referral to Thoracic Surgeon:** For potential biopsy and surgical treatment. Dr. Emily Roberts. - **Prescribed Medication:** - Albuterol Inhaler, 90 mcg/inhalation, 2 puffs every 4 to 6 hours as needed for shortness of breath. - **Referral for Imaging:** - PET-CT scan of the thorax to assess the extent of the disease. - **Blood Work:** - Complete Blood Count (CBC) for hematology. - Liver function tests for biochemistry. - Cancer markers (CA 19-9, CEA). - **Patient Education and Counseling:** - Discussed the probable diagnosis and the need for further diagnostic procedures and possible treatment options. - Encouraged the patient to adhere to medication and follow-up appointments. - Provided information on smoking cessation support, considering the patient's history of heavy smoking. - **Follow-Up:** - Schedule an appointment after PET-CT results are available to discuss further management and treatment options.
